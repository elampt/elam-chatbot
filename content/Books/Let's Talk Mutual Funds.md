## Points to remember 
1. A good investment is not just about the highest return, but also about low costs, liquidity and having access to the money when needed

2. Page number 45 - 37 mutual fund categories in India

## Equity Funds

• Investing in Nifty 50 instead of large cap is a better choice 

• Flexi cap - doesn't seem very promising. Else it would have outperformed all other categories 

• Focused fund - Sats within a restriction of a maximum of thirty stocks across any market cap or style (Very tightly focused portfolio). Riskier 

• ELSS - Eligible for Section 80C tax benifit, three year lock-in period. Average 10 year returns on this is 15%

• Sectoral/thematic funds - For mature investors allready having a basic portfolio in place 

## Debt Funds
Best for 3-4 year timeframe investments

 • Corporate funds (AA and below )- Funds that invest in non government bonds, high return and high risk 

• Gilt funds - Invest only government securities. Fairly good returns over long time

• Banking and public sector undertaking (PSU) - Invest in bond papers of banks, public sector units and public financial institutions. Lower credit risk

## Hybrid funds 
• Conservative hybrid - Good for seeking regular income in future by using SWP


## Risk measures (While comparing funds):
1. Standard deviation : 
	Lower standard deviation is less risky than a higher standard deviation
2. Beta :
	Measures how far away from the benchmark is the fund return. Lower beta is less riskier than a higher beta

	**Benchmark :**
	Standard deviation - low
	Alpha - high
	Beta - low
	Sharpe ratio - high
	Sortino ratio - high 


## Taxes:
The joy of tax-paid wealth is the ability to sleep peacefully at night, to look yourself and your children in the eye
1. There are some funds that support Section 54 EC to invest in bonds that turn the profit tax free
2. Know a out 80C - 1.5L tax deduction 


## Things I might have done wrong:
1. The books says holding mutual fund as SOA instead of Demat is cost effective
	However, Demat is a better format to hold multiple type of investments
