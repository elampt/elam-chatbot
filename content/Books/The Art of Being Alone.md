## Key Takeaways
**Self love is about two things:**
1. Knowing Yourself 
2. Accepting Yourself 

• Happiness is so effortless when you are around a baby (You don't judge them and neither they you)

• Learn to be happy for no reason

• "Missing the people who you cannot be with any more and realising that you wouldn't be able to meet the people who were a part of you creates loneliness"

• "It's the relaxed mind that generates more ideas than a stuffed mind which is so full that it might throw up (in the form of stress)"

• You are who you are, whether you like it or not, so why not like it ?

• You cannot expect life to create reasons for you to be happy, cheerful and successful. If you want something, you go get it

• The problem is that we are making our lives a collection of cheap dreams that everyone imagines and materialistic shit that everyone else possesses


## To be happy:
1. Free yourself and others 
2. Never expect anyone to stay with you forever. Except for you, no one is going to stay with you forever 
3. Learn to belong to yourself without feeling the need to be with others. Where there is a need, there is a settlement. You will settle for less

## To do:
1. Talk to myself for 15 mins daily 

2. Find out who I am/ who I am not

3. Write down five things that you don't like in your life right now. Figure out what my dream version of life is. Only then I can work towards it 

4. "As you practice the art of doing nothing, you leave your mind free to wander the distinct world inside you while being fully, completely, absolutely aware of where your mind is leading you"

5. Become friends with my goals and dreams, with success and achievements 

6. Learn to define my definition of everything. Don't make my life a wishlist of what I think everyone has

7. Be honest with myself 

8. Focus on one thing at a time
