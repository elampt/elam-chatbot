# Welcome 👋

Hey there! I am Elam and this is my **personal knowledge garden** 🌱 — a living, evolving space where I document what I'm learning across tech, data, AI, and beyond.

You'll find:
- ✍️ Notes from courses and projects  
- 🧪 Experiments in Python, FastAPI, and GenAI  
- 📊 Explorations in data analysis & backend engineering  
- 🚀 Mini-builds, weekend hacks, and thoughts along the way

> 💡 _“Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard.”_ – David McCullough
